# USEless Framework
USEless Framework - Provides highest Level of abstraction

### Main Features

1. Solves neverending competing standards paradigm http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png
2. Provides highest level of abstraction for all utility libraries
3. Compiles your native language to almost all existing programing languages. Supports even languages like latin.
4. Supports "three valued" booleans with syntax if/else/whatever.
5. Build upon concept use less do more.
6. Provides own scripting language so you can write own useless code. Here you can download example script http://downloads.useless.com/examples/script.void
7. You can put useless code anywhere and it won’t break anything. That way, you can achive absolutely nothing, get paid and go home.
8. Implements EDP API 2.0, more can be found here http://exception.disoriented.programming.org
9. Provides bridge between two type of things everything and nothing.
10. Performance boosted with "eager lazy loading"
11. Introduces obese client library called KlumpJS

### Modules

#### Bootstrap Wrapper

Thin, almost invisible layer wrapping award-winning, widely-used-without-reason Bootstrap library. Supports all versions and adds no features to ensure backward compability. It's so thin, that after obfuscation, concatenation and minification we decreased it's weight to 0kb. We achived that by writing no code at first place, but it's not important - we want to get paid for work, right? And don't worry, we attached also original script source to have one more file in our repository.

##### USAGE
Usage is incredibly simple. To keep it that way, we followed KISS, DRY and other useless principles, but we failed.  

First, include latest boostrap-wrapper script:
```
<script src="bootstrap-wrapper-all-final-latest-production.min.js"></script>
```

Then just include this 2 lines in your html:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

and it will JustWork&#8482;!

#### USEless compiler

Patented HARMless MODE now available. Beginners can now safely write their code. How this was achieved? In HARMLess mode each void file is assembled,compiled and then goes to dev null.

#### USEless Language

New keywords available like omit

#### KlumpJS

Write your application as so far and then deploy it using USEless deployment tools...
